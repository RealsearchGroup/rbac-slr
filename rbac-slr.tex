% This file contains modifications for Procedia Computer Science
% but may easily be adapted to other journals

% Changes since version 1.1
% - added "procedia" option compliant with ecrc.sty version 1.2a
%   (makes the layout approximately the same as the Word CRC template)
% - added example for generating copyright line in abstract

%% The '3p' and 'times' class options of elsarticle are used for Elsevier CRC
%% Add the 'procedia' option to approximate to the Word template
%\documentclass[3p,times,procedia]{elsarticle}
\documentclass[3p,times]{elsarticle}

%% The `ecrc' package must be called to make the CRC functionality available
\usepackage{ecrc}

%% The ecrc package defines commands needed for running heads and logos.
%% For running heads, you can set the journal name, the volume, the starting page and the authors

%% set the volume if you know. Otherwise `00'
\volume{00}

%% set the starting page if not 1
\firstpage{1}

%% Give the name of the journal
\journalname{Information and Software Technology}


%% Give the author list to appear in the running head
%% Example \runauth{C.V. Radhakrishnan et al.}
\runauth{}

%% The choice of journal logo is determined by the \jid and \jnltitlelogo commands.
%% A user-supplied logo with the name <\jid>logo.pdf will be inserted if present.
%% e.g. if \jid{yspmi} the system will look for a file yspmilogo.pdf
%% Otherwise the content of \jnltitlelogo will be set between horizontal lines as a default logo

%% Give the abbreviation of the Journal.  Contact the journal editorial office if in any doubt
\jid{procs}

%% Give a short journal name for the dummy logo (if needed)
\jnltitlelogo{IST}

%% Provide the copyright line to appear in the abstract
%% Usage:
%   \CopyrightLine[<text-before-year>]{<year>}{<restt-of-the-copyright-text>}
%   \CopyrightLine[Crown copyright]{2011}{Published by Elsevier Ltd.}
%   \CopyrightLine{2011}{Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved}
\CopyrightLine{2011}{Published by Elsevier Ltd.}

%% Hereafter the template follows `elsarticle'.
%% For more details see the existing template files elsarticle-template-harv.tex and elsarticle-template-num.tex.

%% Elsevier CRC generally uses a numbered reference style
%% For this, the conventions of elsarticle-template-num.tex should be followed (included below)
%% If using BibTeX, use the style file elsarticle-num.bst

%% End of ecrc-specific commands
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% The amssymb package provides various useful mathematical symbols
\usepackage{amssymb}
%% The amsthm package provides extended theorem environments
%% \usepackage{amsthm}

%% The lineno packages adds line numbers. Start line numbering with
%% \begin{linenumbers}, end it with \end{linenumbers}. Or switch it on
%% for the whole article with \linenumbers after \end{frontmatter}.
%% \usepackage{lineno}

%\usepackage{natbib}

%% natbib.sty is loaded by default. However, natbib options can be
%% provided with \biboptions{...} command. Following options are
%% valid:

%%   round  -  round parentheses are used (default)
%%   square -  square brackets are used   [option]
%%   curly  -  curly braces are used      {option}
%%   angle  -  angle brackets are used    <option>
%%   semicolon  -  multiple citations separated by semi-colon
%%   colon  - same as semicolon, an earlier confusion
%%   comma  -  separated by comma
%%   numbers-  selects numerical citations
%%   super  -  numerical citations as superscripts
%%   sort   -  sorts multiple citations according to order in ref. list
%%   sort&compress   -  like sort, but also compresses numerical citations
%%   compress - compresses without sorting
%%
%% \biboptions{comma,round}

% \biboptions{}

% if you have landscape tables

\begin{abstract}
%% Text of abstract


Role-based access control (RBAC) has become an increasingly popular access
control for various applications such as web applications and
database applications. RBAC restricts access to resources based on identity of subjects and/or groups
called roles. 
Since RBAC is introduced in 1998, researchers have proposed various extended models of RBAC.
For example, they define additional constraints among roles (e.g., temporal constraints or location constraints) or hierarchy relationship of roles.
Our goal of this work is to study extended models of RBAC and analyze their extended features and claimed research contributions
to find limitations of current RBAC models and what extent of extended features that can be used for future RBAC.
We conduct a systematic literature review by collecting and synthesizing relevant research
papers. We initially collect XXXX papers from various sources such as IEEE and ACM websites and selected 26 papers systemically.
We perform a comparative analysis to find relationships among extended models and RBAC.
