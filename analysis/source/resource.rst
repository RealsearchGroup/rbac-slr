----------------------------------------------------

**A Flexible Role- and Resource-Based Access Control Model**

    Inspired by a real example? Scenarios or examples.
        No.

    What reasons and evidence do researchers claim RBAC needs extension?
        - RBAC cannot support multiple security domains
        - cannot support same security with different applications
        - lack of flexibility in authorization
        - discard role heirarchy for directory structure to reduce complexity and increase flexibility

    Did they implement the model?
        No.

    Is there an evaluation? If yes, how did they do one? If no, why?
        Comparison of the two models from a qualitative standpoint

    Does this model extend the core model?
        - Not an extension
        - Re-imagining of the hierarchy aspect and adding a resources entity

    Notes.
