Constraint
    * No evaluation
Context
    * Present hospital scenarios and explanation of how new model would handle
    * No
    * No
    * No
    * No
    * Scenarios with how model affects, performance test of the model vs. traditional RBAC
    * Description of a fake project management system that the model is designed for
    * Applied to conceptual situation
    * No
    * Example scenario comparing their model vs other models 
Delegation
    * No
Organizational
    * Comparison caluclation for number of roles vs standard model, numerical size comparisons against other proposed models
Privacy
    * Evaluate the performance of permission assignment and authorization checks for various sizes and context variables
    * No
Resource
    * Model comparison from a qualitative standpoint
Spatial 
    * Algorithm and Big-O performance evaluation
    * No except minor scenarios and how the model handles
    * No other than mathematical specification
Spatio/Temporal
    * Mathematical description
    * Mathematical analysis of role graph, complexity comparisons across different models
    * Pseudo example scenario
    * No
    * Detailed scenario with examination of how model handles situation
    * Discuess difference btween their model and other models, time-complexity analysis to show no performance impact with standard model
Task
    * No
    * No
    * No
Temporal
    * Mathematical modeling and graphs to detail usage and interactions, explanation of example scenarios
