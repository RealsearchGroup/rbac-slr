 RQ5. Do these models have corresponding implementations in practice?
================================================================================

When designing and proposing a model targeted at a feature that is rooted in practical
usage by real software systems, bringing the model to life is strong evidence that the
proposed model can work in practice.  The concept of authorization, and access control
is rooted in a business need.  Thus, any access control model needs to be feasible
in the real world not just on paper.  We analyzed the primary sources to see how many
proposed models actually had implmenetations associated with them.  And quantified the
type of implementation.  Whether the implementation was for a real system, for a prototype
and/or used in a production environment.
