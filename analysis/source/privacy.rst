**Privacy-aware role-based access control**

    Inspired by a real example? Scenarios or examples.
        - inspired by conventional RBAC's inability to handle privacy
        - extra attributes are needed to support the intricacies of privacy

    What reasons and evidence do researchers claim RBAC needs extension?

    Did they implement the model?

    Is there an evaluation? If yes, how did they do one? If no, why?

    Does this model extend the core model?

    Notes.
