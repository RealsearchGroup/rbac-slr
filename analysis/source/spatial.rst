----------------------------------------------------

**GEO-RBAC: a spatially aware RBAC**

    Inspired by a real example? Scenarios or examples.

    What reasons and evidence do researchers claim RBAC needs extension?

    Did they implement the model?

    Is there an evaluation? If yes, how did they do one? If no, why?

    Does this model extend the core model?

    Notes.
