\subsection{Extraction}

After selection of primary sources, the next step was to extract data from each paper that pertained to our research questions in order to look for trends.  The first step was to take the individual data generated from the final elimination round and organize this information around the research questions.  During the paper reading round, and resulting data, the fact that the papers were logically falling into a number of categorizations became evident.  Thus, the first step undertaken was to answer the question of what categories exist for the RBAC model extensions and what papers feel into what categories.  Each paper deemed a primary source and the papers associated categorization are shown in Table \ref{tab:categorization}.

Given that there were multiple papers for some categories, the researchers decided to tackle all further research questions by first analyzing the research question on a per category basis and then looking across all categories for generalization and trends.
