\section{Categorization} \label{sec:categorization}

After selection of primary sources, the next step was to extract data from each paper that pertained to our research questions in order to look for trends.  The first step was to take the individual data generated from the final elimination round and organize this information around the research questions.  During the paper reading round, and resulting data, the fact that the papers were logically falling into a number of categorizations became evident.  Thus, the first step undertaken was to answer the question of what categories exist for the RBAC model extensions and what papers feel into what categories.  Each paper deemed a primary source and the papers associated categorization are shown in Table \ref{tab:categorization}.

\subsection{Research Question 1}

What categories exist within RBAC extensions? \\

The primary sources contained either within the title, or by multiple references within the body of the text a reference to a quantifier for the
type of extension their model was.  For example, the paper "Privacy-aware role-based access control" \cite{ni2010privacy} contained "privacy" in
the title leading to the papers categorization of Privacy.  By comparison, the paper "An extended RBAC model based on granular logic" \cite{jian2008extended}
does not contain a direct categorization in the title or model name, but in reading the body of the paper the authors assessed that this paper was 
context based.  The authors offer definitions for each categorization and their characteristics based on the primary sources and the English definitions
for each.

\begin{itemize}

  \item Constraint: Access control model in this category extends constraints, which are conditional restrictions on permissions of given roles. This constraint is either static and dynamic. For example, a doctor can modify any medical record for which the doctor is assigned as the designated primary care physician. This example describes doctor's permission with conditional restriction, "only when the doctor is assigned as the designated primary care physician".

  \item Context: Access control model integrates context information. In access control, context often refers to user's current state and environment information (e.g., location, time, system resources, network state, network security configuration, etc) which may affect user's access privileges.

  \item Organizational: Organizational access control is concerned with access control associated with multiple organizations. Typically, users may have the same role name in different organizations, but may have different access privileges due to different local variations.
  
  \item Privacy: Access control model can be extended to describe privacy policies, which are legal statements or documents about disclose and management of personally identifiable information such as name, address, data of birth, etc.

  \item Resource: Access control model can be extended to handle any system resources (e.g., a file, printer, terminal, database record, etc) in a flexible way. 

  \item Spatial:  Spatial constraints are location-based constraints in specifying access
	control policies. For example, in organizations, 	locations are enforced while a
	specific role is permitted to conduct an action. Consider that part-time employee works only in specific location.
	In such cases, the part-time employee role should access required resources only when the user is in the location. 
	Spatial constraints can incorporate either on roles, user-role assignments, or role-permission assignments. 

  \item Spatio-Temporal: Spatio-temporal constraints are combination of spatial (location-based) and temporal (time-based) constraints in specifying access control policies. For example, specific locations are enforced while a role is permitted to conduct an action from 8 am to 5 pm.

  \item Task: A task is a fundamental unit of a business activity. Different from core RBAC, in task-role-based access control model, roles are not directly associated with permissions. Roles are first associated with tasks, which are associated permissions. For example, the employee role is associated with a task, which is to write a report. Then, this task is associated with a permission.

  \item Temporal:  Temporal constraints are time-based constraints in specifying access
	control policies. For example, in organizations, 	periodic temporal durations are enforced while a
	specific role is permitted to conduct an action. Consider that part-time employee works only from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.
	In such cases, the part-time employee role should access required resources during the interval. 
	Temporal constraints can incorporate either on roles, user-role assignments, or role-permission assignments.
