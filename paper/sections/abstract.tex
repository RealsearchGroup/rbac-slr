Role-based access control (RBAC) has become an increasingly popular access
control for various applications such as web applications and
database applications. RBAC restricts access to resources based on identity of subjects and/or groups
called roles. 
Since RBAC is introduced in 1998, researchers have proposed various extended models of RBAC.
For example, they define additional constraints among roles (e.g., temporal constraints or location constraints) or hierarchy relationship of roles.
Our goal of this work is to study extended models of RBAC and analyze their extended features and claimed research contributions
to find limitations of current RBAC models and what extent of extended features that can be used for future RBAC.
We conduct a systematic literature review by collecting and synthesizing relevant research
papers. We initially collect XXXX papers from various sources such as IEEE and ACM websites and selected 26 papers systemically.
We perform a comparative analysis to find relationships among extended models and RBAC.
