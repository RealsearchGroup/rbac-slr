**ROBAC: Scalable Role and Organization Based Access Control Models**

    Inspired by a real example? Scenarios or examples.
        - inspired by context from business-to-business and business-to-consumer context
        - a theoritical web based report delivery system e.g. a set of educational professionals from schools, districts, and states
        - also provide example of an online tutoring system

    What reasons and evidence do researchers claim RBAC needs extension?
        - claim that their model can significantly reduce administrative complexity for multi-organization
        - more succint and intuitive than RBAC
        - same expressive power

    Did they implement the model?

    Is there an evaluation? If yes, how did they do one? If no, why?
        - present comparison calculations for the number of roles that must be generated between their model and standard
        - provide numerical size comparisons with other proposed models (Role Templates, Team-based Access Control, Organizational Units

    Does this model extend the core model?
        - extension of RBAC to consider organization and role (a.k.a. context)
        - an organization must own the object, and the role must give permission on the type for a user to access
