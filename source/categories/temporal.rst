----------------------------------------------------

**A generalized temporal role-based access control model**

    Inspired by a real example? Scenarios or examples.
        In many organizations, processes and functions may have limited time spans or have periodic temporal durations

    What reasons and evidence do researchers claim RBAC needs extension?
        - Workflow based organizations need a time based constraint for disabling/enabling roles

    Did they implement the model?
        No.

    Is there an evaluation? If yes, how did they do one? If no, why?
        - Model is limited to enabling/disabling of roles based on time constraints only
        - model is fully described from entities, to constraints, to conflict resolution to execution in pseudo-code
        - Evaluation lies in the construction of mathematical modeling and graphs to detail the usage and interaction of the model pieces
        - A few example scenarios are explained

    Does this model extend the core model?
        - Extension of the base RBAC model
        - adds periodicity and duration constraints for role enabling
        - provides for conflict resolution of constraints
